Unzip the driver tar and , while installing the driver via Device Manager in Windows 7
point the folder to the unzipped location and it'll pick the drivers and install it 
afterwords.

Grab the latest tar from this location: https://www.fischl.de/usbasp/

Btw, I'm using the el-cheapo USBasp from AliX
